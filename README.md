# Missile-defence-system
Embedded Systems: PIC16F877A microcontroller, C code

The projet idea is creating a missile shooting system for detecting and shooting down objetcs. The system operates on two modes, automatic and manual, the first uses sensors to detect the object distance and takes the decision based on the object's distance, and the second is user controlled.

The project incorporated the use of microcontrollers, several sensors, and actuators. The defense system utilizes an ultrasonic radar to detect if objects are in the danger range. The ultrasonic sensor scans 180 degrees horizontally through a servo motor. The shooting mechanism is based on 3 servo motors; two for moving vertically and horizontally, and one for firing the missile. The manual option was implemented through a remote control.
